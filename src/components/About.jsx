      Hey- ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kent, a passionate software developer based in Florida, USA.

Iâ€™m about to complete a full-stack Web Development Bootcamp, which has been a transformative experience both personally and professionally. My journey into technology began in 2020, when I started studying computer science. In 2023, I completed a Masters in Information Technology, and for my final project, I created a comprehensive database of drug treatment centers in Florida using MS SQL Server. This project opened my eyes to how technology can be leveraged to solve real-world problems, and it sparked my interest in learning more dynamic, in-demand technologies.

To dive deeper, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp, where I expanded my skills with technologies like JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js and more. Throughout the bootcamp, I worked on several exciting projects, including a Book Reviewer App, a Tech Blog, a Social Network API, and an E-Commerce Back Endâ€”each showcasing my ability to apply these technologies to build functional, scalable solutions.

As I complete the bootcamp, Iâ€™m excited to embark on my next chapter as a full-time software developer. Iâ€™m eager to continue building applications that make an impact and to explore new challenges in the ever-evolving world of tech.
